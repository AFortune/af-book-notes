This poem is often seen as a poem about poetry itself, but I think we
can also read it as we think about our understandings of God and
also our own theologies. I have taken my theology very seriously
throughout my life. Its kind of part of my job now, but this has
not always been good or safe. There is a certain kind of danger to
living a good life, and I think there is even more if you want to
live a holy life. The greater your goal the more desperately you
might be tempted to pursue it and desparation sometimes can lead us
astray even as we seek the best things.

This has happened to me a few times so far, and I think that this
has made me a little gun-shy when I encounter different parts my
faith and theology. I have two voices that will pop into my head
when I think about God or scripture. One voice is the
detached/despairing skeptic who does not see the relevance of the
passage; the other voice is the obsessive angry fundamentalist
who wants to read the text or see the idea in the most horrible,
unhopeful light.

I have worked really hard to fight of these two voices, and God has
given me some serious victory, but it is still hard at times. One
thing that been helpful though is studying theology outside of my
tradition.

I guess you could call this to borrow a phrase from the title of
one of John Milbanks book's, _The Word Made Strange_. When I hear
scripture interpreted from a different standpoint or tradition I
can sometimes silence the voices of my two inner tormentors. This
is because on one hand the distance I have from the tradition makes
me feel like it has fewer demands on me. And on the other, the
difference in expression can some times help me slip some real
truth by my defenses at the same time.

When we hear the truth told slant to us by other traditions, then
we have a chance to hear it afreash including parts we often miss
out on. Once this is done then we can return to our own tradition
with fresher eyes.

Another thing this can help with is avoiding what I call border
patrol Christianity. This is a term that I am not totally satisfied
with for how theological debates can some times block out the rest of
what various theologians and traditions or even the Gospel has to
say. It happens when people become so concerned about the areas of
conflict that they can no longer see the rest of their faith. The
controversy comes to block out the rest. This results in a thin
eggshell like faith that would have very little meaning if the
conflict were resolved. It is theologizing motivated only by trying
to define the inner and outer parts of groups in a controversy.

Some of this can be appropriate at times, but if it the begining and
end of our theological reflection then we will run the risk of
having the form of faith without its substance, much like the
Pharasees.

Looking at other traditions can help us avoid this because it
raises issues and questions that might not have occured to us in
the first place. This is some of what C.S. Lewis's intro to
_Athanasius: On the Incarnation_. He claims that we should read old
books and that is in part because they were produced by times that
had different questions and problems. Perhaps they were not making
some of the mistakes that our time is making. This is partly my
interest in this topic of Eastern Orthodoxy as well and that is
some of why I would commend it as an issue for study. In a future
post I will look at it in some depth and discuss how it has told
the truth to me slant.
