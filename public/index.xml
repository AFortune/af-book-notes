      <description>If you are like me you probably own more nice looking notebooks than you have finished writing in. Buying a notebook is mostly like buying a difficult but impressive book to read. When you buy it you are buying what it promises to be for you. It promises to make you well read, or in the case of the notebook, it promises that you will have ideas worth writing down.</description>
